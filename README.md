# Snapd-rs

A minimal API client for the snapd rest API.

Provides a client to access snapd, which allows you to manage, search and install [snaps](https://snapcraft.io/) on a Linux system.


### Implementation

The functionality provided by this client is adapted from [snapd.dart](https://github.com/canonical/snapd.dart).
